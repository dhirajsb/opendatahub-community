title: ML Model Registry
---

**Introduction**

Model Registry in an ML DevOps environment is a central repository for storing metadata about ML models.
It is an important component in the life cycle of AI/ML models. 
A model registry provides a central repository for model developers to store and manage models, versions, and model metadata. 
It fills a gap between model experimentation and model serving activities. It provides a central interface for 
stakeholders in the ML life cycle to collaborate on models in a secure fashion.

During the development and deployment life cycle of an ML model, various artifacts and metadata are created or associated with the ML model.
For example, a *Data Scientist* may create training data, hyperparameters, metrics during development. 
During deployment, an *MLOps Engineer* may work with a versioned Model from the repository for model-serving to provide Inferencing on the Model. 
Pre-trained ML models such as Foundation Models when used directly for model serving will include metadata about their artifacts and hyperparameters. 
Model serving will generate metrics from inference. 
Execution of actions and events performed during the model's lifecycle, for example in a pipeline that executes various steps to process and transform data, can also be stored as metadata. 

There needs to be a central repository for all such metadata so that it can provide visibility across the entire lifecycle of the model. 
It should be able to provide lineage and provenance for any artifact or metadata related to an ML model. 

**Design Goals**

* Model Registry should be a passive repository which receives and stores ML model related metadata pushed to the registry.
* The registry may have simple rules for validating metadata, but it does not take any actions or perform any orchestration based on this metadata. 
* The metadata can be pushed to the repository using client libraries in code written by ML users or automatically generated by other ODH components in the platform. 
For example, metadata about the deployment status of an ML Model. 
* The Model Registry should also support Kubernetes native deployment just like other Open Data Hub Components. 

**User Use Cases**
- *Data Scientists* need access to a Model Registry to store information about Experiments and Runs for Tracking and reproducibility. 
- *Data Scientists* can register versions of ML models in the Model Registry to share with other *Data Scientists* and *MLOps Engineers*. 
- *Data Scientists* and *MLOps Engineers* can design and implement kubeflow pipelines that register their artifacts and executions in the Model Registry. 
- *Data Scientists* and *MLOps Engineers* can browse the Model Registry to deploy ML models to various environments (e.g. deployment stages like *Stage* and *Production*, locations like *East, West* or specific devices).
